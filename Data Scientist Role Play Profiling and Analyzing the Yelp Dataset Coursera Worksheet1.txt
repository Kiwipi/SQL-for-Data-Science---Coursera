Data Scientist Role Play Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this worksheet. It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1 Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table =10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id:1000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. Category =business_id:2643
iv. Attribute = business_id:1115
v. Review =id:10000,  business_id:8090, user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493 
vii. Photo =id:10000 , business_id:6493
viii. Tip = user_id: 537, business_id:3979
ix. User = id: 10000
x. Friend = user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years =user_id:2780

Note Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table Indicate yes, or no.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results


Posting more reviews may contribute to gaining more fans, but it does not necessarily correlate. As evidenced by the results, Lissa, with 831 reviews, gained only 120 fans. In contrast, Bernice posted 70% fewer reviews (255 in total) but has nearly the same number of fans. Additionally, Rebecca, with just 6 reviews, already has 69 fans, a count comparable to Princeton, who has posted significantly more reviews (98% more). These examples suggest that factors beyond the quantity of reviews may influence the number of fans gained.

Part 2 Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I have picked Las Vegas city and Shopping Category as below

SELECT b.name,  b.city, ca.category,
    CASE 
    WHEN b.stars <=3 THEN '2-3 stars'
    WHEN b.stars >3 Then '4-5 stars'
    END AS stars
FROM business b 
JOIN category ca
ON b.id =ca.business_id
WHERE (b.city = 'Las Vegas'
AND ca.category LIKE 'SHOPPING')
ORDER BY stars DESC

| Walgreens                      | Las Vegas | Shopping | 2-3 stars |
+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+-----------+

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours

From the result I got, I can see 4-5 stars shopping center mostly have shorter business hours(average 8-9 hours a day) and Sunday off, while 2-3 stars open 7 days a week and long buisness hours last for 14 hours a day.

SELECT b.name,  
    b.city, 
    ca.category,
    CASE

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews
         
You can see there are more reviews on 4-5 stars places than 2-3 stars'. Except Desert Medical Equipment has 4 reviews which fewer than 2-3stars Walgreens

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups Explain.

SQL code used for analysis

I can infer that the location does not hinder the delivery of good customer service in this scenario.
This is evident from the presence of two shopping centers in the same location (89121). Wooly Wonders, with a rating of 4-5 stars, 
and another Walgreens, with only 2-3 stars, both coexist, suggesting that customer service quality is not solely determined by the location.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1
The average review numbers are higher for open busines.
			Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
			Closed: AVG(review_count0 = 23.198
         
ii. Difference 2
The open business have higher rating than the closed ones.
         		Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
			Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520
         
SQL code used for analysis
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS no_of_business,
			   ROUND(AVG(stars), 2) AS rating,
			   SUM(review_count) AS review_no,
			   ROUND(AVG(review_count), 2) AS average_review_no, 										
			(CASE WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'OPEN' WHEN is_open = 0 THEN 'Closed' END ) AS Status
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
+----------------+--------+-----------+-------------------+--------+
| NO_of_business | rating | review_no | average_review_no | Status |
+----------------+--------+-----------+-------------------+--------+
|           1520 |   3.52 |     35261 |              23.2 | Closed |
|           8480 |   3.68 |    269300 |              31.8 | Open   |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do
I am choosing to see total reviews of each user, total fans they have, active years since jpined yelping and average rating they have gave so far.
          
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data
From analysing the total reviews and fans they have, calculating how many fans they will get after post a review.     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset
1) Most of users had been used Yelping for over 10 years, no matter how many fans they have. It seems that fans gaining rate do not affecting by how many year they have joined yelping.
2) Based on the result, it shows the number of reviews a user rate won't nescessary help gaining fans number. As the top 5 fans gaining rate, 2 of users only gave 10 reviews but with around 0.4 fans per review.
       
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset

SELECT u.name, 
sum(u.review_count) as Total_reviews, 
sum(u.fans) as Total_fans, 
ROUND(sum(u.fans)*1.0/sum(u.review_count), 2) as fansgaining_per_review,
(date('now') - u.yelping_since) as yelping_active_years, 
avg(r.stars)
FROM user u JOIN review r
ON u.id= r.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY fansgaining_per_review DESC
